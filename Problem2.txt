Create a C++ function named "CountPermutations" that determines the total number of
permutations of an array A of length N containing distinct integers, such that for all pairs (i, j)
with 1≤i≤ j ≤ N and (i + j) being an odd number:

(Ai + Aj)%2 = K
where K is either 0 or 1.
The function should accept two parameters: an integer K and a
vector<int> named A representing the array of distinct integers.
The function should return an integer indicating the count of such permutations modulo 1e9 +7.
The function `CountPermutations should handle input parameters within the following ranges:
The length of the array N is between 1 and 1e5.
Each element of the array A is a distinct integer within the range [1, 1e9].
The integer K is either 0 or 1.
